## About

### What is it?

The fhevm Gateway is a set of smart contracts that enables decrypting FHE ciphertexts from different host chains. It
acts as an intermediary between the chains, the Key Management Service (KMS) and the coprocessors found within the fhevm
protocol. These contracts are responsible for:

- Verifying the legitimacy of decryption requests
- Centralizing multi-chain ciphertexts access
- Centralizing multi-chain ciphertexts commitments
- Orchestrating KMS materials

### Main features
